Markdown Guide Extension
=======================

* Version: 2.0β1
* Author: Will P (beiju@iwillsite.com)
* Build Date: 30 May 2010
* Requirements: Tested on Symphony CMS 2.0.8RC3

Installation
------------

1. Upload the 'formatting_guides' folder to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the *Formatting Guides* extension, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, and then click Apply.

3. Now the condensed guide will appear below any textarea field that uses one of the enabled text formatter options.

4. To add another description, creat a new .txt file in the 'formatting_guides/guides' folder, named with the formatting option as reported by Symphony. This file should be formatted with HTML (and no, the irony is not lost on me).

TODO
----

* Add an option to the textarea field to suppress the guide even when a markdown text formatter is being used.

* Make it easier to discover the formatting option of any text field.
